# Logistics
We are all available to meet on campus on Tuesday and Thursday from 10:45am to 12:30pm and from 1:45pm to 3:30pm. Our weekly meeting(s) will be during those times. 
This week and next meeting, we will talk about the project idea and managing the inital stages of the project. The next two weeks after that will be dedicated towards evaluating tasks and planning which data structures will be needed, as well as pulling data for backend implementation. During the fifth stage of the project, we will discuss the current progress and next steps, and present our rough draft. The couple weeks will be polishing up the draft and adding any additional implementations and improvements. Finally, the final presentation will be in class, where we present our full application.

Our working hours are pretty late at night.
We all have very good response times. We expect team members to respond within 24 hours to any message sent. We will all respond between the hours of 10am - 12am.

# Roles
Alice will be the Project Lead; Josephine will be the front-end developer; Chris will be the back-end developer. 
If we run into disagreements, we will talk it out and move forward when we reach a compromise everyone is happy with. Other conflicts can be resolved in group meetings where we all communicate our issues and what we need to move forward with the project.

# Chris' Brainstorming
Track 1:
    IdeaA - An App where you can invite ppl over to play sports with you
    IdeaB - An app with a Tamagotchi for time spent outside(like that one app where you "water a plant" by drinking water)
Track 2:
    IdeaA - An app to store all of your syllabi for the semester(and past semesters), perhaps can share with others
    IdeaB - An app that keeps track of what Office hours are available and when for your classes. Makes it very easy to see, and you wont have to check your syllabus or calendar to figure it out.
Track 3:
    IdeaA - An app where users can log(with a picture) cultrually relevant locations/art/food onto a shared map for others to see
    IdeaB - An app where users can share art(with an artists statement) from their location, and the app will tell you how far away they are from you. This will help inspire artists because they will be able to see how many other talented artsists are around them.
