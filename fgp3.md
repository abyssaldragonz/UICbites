# Logistics
We are all available to meet on campus on Tuesday and Thursday from 10:45am to 12:30pm and from 1:45pm to 3:30pm. Our weekly meeting(s) will be during those times. 
This week and next meeting, we will talk about the project idea and managing the inital stages of the project. The next two weeks after that will be dedicated towards evaluating tasks and planning which data structures will be needed, as well as pulling data for backend implementation. During the fifth stage of the project, we will discuss the current progress and next steps, and present our rough draft. The couple weeks will be polishing up the draft and adding any additional implementations and improvements. Finally, the final presentation will be in class, where we present our full application.

# Chris' Brainstorming
Track 1:
    IdeaA - An App where you can invite ppl over to play sports with you
    IdeaB - An app (wellness wins) where people can share physical or mental health wins that theyve had during the week and others can support them.
Track 2:
    IdeaA - An app to store all of your syllabi for the semester(and past semesters), perhaps can share with others
    IdeaB - An app that keeps track of what Office hours are available and when for your classes. Makes it very easy to see, and you wont have to check your syllabus or calendar to figure it out.
Track 3:
    IdeaA - An app where users can log(with a picture) cultrually relevant locations/art/food onto a shared map for others to see
    IdeaB - An app where users can share art(with an artists statement) from their location, and the app will tell you how far away they are from you. This will help inspire artists because they will be able to see how many other talented artsists are around them.

# Alice's Brainstorming
Track 1: 
    IdeaA - An app that only allows you screentime to certain apps after you have gone out on a walk or logged physical activity somehow.
    IdeaB - An app that controls what time you are allowed to access certain apps. For example, not allowing you to access apps first thing in the morning or during school/work time.
Track 2: 
    IdeaA - An app where users can input each assignment per class throughout an entire semester in order to create an optimized study/homework schedule.
    IdeaB - An app that contains a map of the inside of buildings in UIC, with directions on how to get to hard-to-find rooms.
Track 3:
    IdeaA - An app where users can join groups based on their cultural interests and communicate in order to share events to those who are interested more easily.
    IdeaB - An app that has a map that shows you upcoming events in an area when you click on a particular neighborhood within the city.
