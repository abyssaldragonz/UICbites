# Logistics
We are all available to meet on campus on Tuesday and Thursday from 10:45am to 12:30pm and from 1:45pm to 3:30pm. Our weekly meeting(s) will be during those times. 
This week and next meeting, we will talk about the project idea and managing the inital stages of the project. The next two weeks after that will be dedicated towards evaluating tasks and planning which data structures will be needed, as well as pulling data for backend implementation. During the fifth stage of the project, we will discuss the current progress and next steps, and present our rough draft. The couple weeks will be polishing up the draft and adding any additional implementations and improvements. Finally, the final presentation will be in class, where we present our full application.
