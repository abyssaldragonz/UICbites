## Meeting Notes: 
- finalizing information for meeting with TA
- worked on figma design some more
- TA Meeting Prep:
    - Ethical Issues and how we reduce impact:
        - Bias due to googles rating system.
        - Close restuarants will be promoted more.
        - We can mitigate these issues by not including our own rating system and by allowing users to sort restaurants based on other factors than distance.
    - figuring out timeline
        - (10) finalizing figma design and project idea/features after meeting with TA
        - (spring break): break! and possibly more react and data pulling
        - (11) backend data pulling + integrating backend data with frontend
        - (12) data structure work + any optimizing
        - (13) final testing for possible application breaks and final debugging
        - (14) polishing site
        - (15) finished app and presentation
    - Source for data extraction / data processing: We are going to be using the google maps API in order to pull data for our website. If we are unable to use that we can also use a third party API like: gmapsextractor.com
    - 2 Advanced Data Structures:
        - Trie: Used for autocomplete for our search functionality.
        - Huffman Encoding: used to compress data. ( may be subject to change)
        - Not viable options: priority queue to hold all the restaurant entries, however, because we are not insreting or deleting, this could easily be done with an array/list.
