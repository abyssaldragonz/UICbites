**Duration**:  11am-12:15pm
**Where**:  ARC 2nd floor

## Recent Progress:
- Backend is 90% finished (including storing data in a priority queue)
- Added more information to the CSV (hours of operation)
- Began discussing when we should have our next TA meeting
- Fixed hours of operation to only display hours for the current day
- Compiled information 


## Meeting Notes: 
- Discussed what we were able to get done over the weekend ( mostly backend and compiling UIC-specific data)
- Discussed what we will do within the next week
    - Josephine and Chris will work together to integrate backend and frontend
    - Alice will put the UIC-specific data in a file to be read by the frontend ( to figure out whether to indicate a restaurant accepts flames fare or gives a UIC student discount)
- We decided that we will probably do our meeting with our TA wednesday afternoon, but we will send the final email later this week
    

## Action Items (Work In Progress):
- Integrate backend and frontend together some more
- Populate information onto website (about us, home page, basic information that can be hardcoded in -- not dynamic)
- Adding info about restaurants (flames fare, discounts, etc.). 
- Prettify the site
