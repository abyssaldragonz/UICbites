## Recent Progress:
- going over data structures in preparation for deciding which ones to use
- discussing over discord about the ideas

## Meeting Notes: 
- discussed pros and cons of each of the track ideas with the most votes
- which ones were feasible, which ones we were the most interested in, which ones we ruled out
- which one of our ideas were similar and how we can combine them

- Alice Track 1 IdeaA: a cool idea starting point that needs to be fleshed out
- Josephine Track 1 IdeaB: a fun idea; not too sure on what data structures to use for this and may be difficult to implement location tracking; could also be combined with Alice's Track 1 IdeaA (above)
- Chris Track 2 IdeaB: a really cool idea, but a little too similar to the office hours queue idea, which we cannot implement for this project
- Alice Track 3 IdeaB: can be combined with Josephine's Track 3 IdeaA for a more fleshed out idea; may be difficult to find culturally relevant events that are up to date

## Action Items (Work In Progress):
- finalize idea and identify which data structures to use
- delegate tasks
